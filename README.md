# Conditional Profile Card
In this project, I had to modify a function to allow dynamic rendering of the input elements without changing anything outside of the `render` function. I learned about writing conditionals in succint way, like this:
`${variables.name || "Lucy}"`

This made my code my shorter and cleaner, avoiding the use of multiline `if` statements.
